# SmartPantry

Cooking made easy with what's on hand.

# Inspiration
The idea for SmartPantry was born out of our personal struggles as busy students living off-campus. We often found ourselves forgetting about groceries we had bought, only to realize they had expired when it was too late. Witnessing perfectly good food go to waste was not only frustrating but also made us more aware of the global food waste problem. This inspired us to create a solution that helps people manage their groceries more efficiently, reducing waste by suggesting recipes based on the ingredients they already have.

# What it does
SmartPantry allows users to keep track of the ingredients they have at home and provides recipe suggestions based on those ingredients. Users can input or scan their groceries to maintain a digital inventory of what they have on hand. As items near their expiration dates, the app sends reminders and suggests recipes to help ensure nothing goes to waste. It also offers quick meal and snack ideas, making it easier to use up groceries efficiently.
